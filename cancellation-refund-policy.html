          <h1>Cancellation and Refund Policy</h1>
          <h2>Effective Date: 25/05/2023</h2>

          <h2>1. Cancellation of Services</h2>
          <h3>1.1 Influencer Services</h3>
          <p>
            If you are an influencer using Incer, you may cancel your
            participation in campaigns or projects at any time. However, please
            note that cancellation after accepting a campaign may result in
            consequences as specified in the campaign terms agreed upon by you
            and the brand.
          </p>

          <h3>1.2 Brand Services</h3>
          <p>
            If you are a brand using Incer, you may cancel your campaign or
            project before it is accepted by an influencer. Once an influencer
            accepts a campaign, cancellation may not be possible, and you will
            be responsible for the agreed-upon compensation.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Refunds</h2>
          <h3>2.1 Influencer Services</h3>
          <p>
            As an influencer, payments made to you for completed campaigns or
            projects are non-refundable. However, in the event of a payment
            error or other exceptional circumstances, please contact us at
            contact@incer.com, and we will review your case on an
            individual basis.
          </p>

          <h3>2.2 Brand Services</h3>
          <p>
            As a brand, payments made for campaigns or projects are
            non-refundable unless there are exceptional circumstances, such as
            non-delivery of services as agreed upon by the influencer. If you
            encounter any issues, please contact us at
            contact@incer.com to discuss the matter further.
          </p>

          <h2>Disputes</h2>
          <p>
            In the event of a dispute between influencers and brands, we
            encourage both parties to communicate and attempt to resolve the
            issue amicably. If a resolution cannot be reached, we may step in as
            a mediator to help facilitate a fair outcome. However, please note
            that we are not responsible for any financial disputes between
            influencers and brands.
          </p>

          <h2>Contact Information</h2>

            Cancellation and Refund Policy, please contact us at
